- understand mesh size -> understand if RAM enough for single variable M -> NOT concerned for macrospin model
- input file/parallelization
- write directly results to output file instead than in variable history
- M is a 6-dimensional array (vector field) -> NO! MACROSPIN MODEL, uniform M
- computation done only inside pillar? ("elliptical" mesh) -> NO! macrospin implies no need of a mesh
- rename M to m
- correct LLG equation according to eq. 21/24 of pdf file and remove SST/thermal fluctuations for first phase
- (optional for the future): implement micromagnetic solver with 3d mesh (much more computationally intensive)
