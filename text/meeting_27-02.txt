- understand mesh size -> understand if RAM enough for single variable M
- input file
- write directly results to output file instead than in variable history
- M is a 6-dimensional array (vector field) -> NO! MACROSPIN MODEL, uniform M
- computation done only inside pillar? ("elliptical" mesh) -> NO! macrospin implies no need of a mesh (right?)
- rename M to m
- correct LLG equation according to teacher and remove SST/thermal fluctuations
